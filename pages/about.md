This site is for my personal documentation regarding my various homelab and dev projects. I try to keep everything easily applicable to different environments but especially the homelab stuff is for my own custom environment. The site is built with [Jekyll] and [Just the Docs] theme. The final site is built using Github Actions and published using [Github Pages].

I have been interested in homelabbing for years and it's always a constantly evolving project which is part of the fun. Experimenting with new setups and apps can be fun and challenging but it can get confusing. That's where documentation comes in. I have settled now on a setup of Proxmox as host OS, TrueNAS Core in a vm providing storage and Docker in LXC on host. I find this setup to be the best for my current homelab hardware and needs. Under the [Homelab] section you can find documentation on how I have built my setup and what I use it for.
